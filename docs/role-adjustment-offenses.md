title: Role Adjustment Offenses
---

Every user who joins Denver Devs is assigned a `member` role after completing onboarding. This role grants them the ability to interact with the community. Without it, they can't even post messages.

Since kicking a user can be circumvented, we recommend adjusting their role if they have not committed a bannable offense. Typically this action would be temporary, the length of time determined upon the severity of the issue.

### Actions that may result in a role adjustment:

- A user can lose their `member` role if they:
  - Engage in a toxic way: useless negativity, rudeness, microaggressions, "well-actually"s, and so on. It is up to the admin team to determine what is toxic in scenarios not defined here.
  - Repeatedly disrupt conversations with off-topic or inappropriate material such as repetitive jokes, attention-seeking, gifs, emoji, and more are considered disruptive. Other actions not defined here may be disruptive; it will be up to the admin team to determine in that scenario.
  - Receive enough warnings from the auto-moderator bot.
  - Spamming the channel with repetitive content, commercial activity, or multi-channel posting.
  - Inappropriate emoji use - such as negative emoji on job posts or offensive emoji from external servers.

### Actions that may result in the loss of a Job Board role:

- Violating the Job Board Rules, in any form.
- Failing to comply with any job board rules after a request to update (24 hours).

### Actions that may result in the loss of a `ticket` role (covid, and politics channels):

- Violating any of the rules mentioned above.
- Appearing to get "too involved" with a conversation, to the point that it may need admin intervention. Use this to help users "cool down" and regain composure.
