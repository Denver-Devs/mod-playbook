Kicking is a "lighter" form of response than banning.

It removes users from the server, but they can join again via any valid invite. This action is easily circumvented since Denver Devs has a public Discord URL.

Kicking is more of an annoyance than an actual form of discipline; whenever possible, you should avoid it and reach for banning or adjustment of a user's roles instead.
